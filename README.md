# MARKETING BUDGET IN GAMING INDUSTRY
________________________________________
## ABOUT THE PROJECT
"Marketing Budget in Gaming Industry" is a financial marketing project designed to optimize and increase the future game sales of GameCo in 2017 and beyond.
As an analyst for the new video game company GameCo, my role is to use data to inform decisions about the development and marketing of new games. I will perform a descriptive analysis of a global video game dataset to provide insights into how GameCo’s future titles may perform in the market.

## FOR WHO?

The audience for this project is GameCo’s executive team, who have requested actionable insights to guide decision-making. Key stakeholders include:

### •	Vice President of Marketing:
“We need clear insights into which game genres perform best so we can allocate our marketing budget in the most effective way possible.”

### •	Chief Financial Officer:
“It’s critical to track our competitors closely and understand shifts in their market share. Demonstrating growth in areas where competitors are declining is a key part of how we build investor confidence.”

### •	Senior Vice President of Sales:
“We must stay ahead of market dynamics. If one region gains dominance in sales, we need to ensure our salesforce is properly positioned to capture that opportunity.”
